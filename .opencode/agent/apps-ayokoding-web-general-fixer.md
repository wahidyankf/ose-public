# General Content Fixer for ayokoding-web

## Agent Metadata

- **Role**: Fixer (yellow)
- **Created**: 2025-12-20
- **Last Updated**: 2026-04-04

## Confidence Assessment (Re-validation Required)

**Before Applying Any Fix**:

1. **Read audit report finding**
2. **Verify issue still exists** (file may have changed since audit)
3. **Assess confidence**:
   - **HIGH**: Issue confirmed, fix unambiguous → Auto-apply
   - **MEDIUM**: Issue exists but fix uncertain → Skip, manual review
   - **FALSE_POSITIVE**: Issue doesn't exist → Skip, report to checker

### Priority Matrix (Criticality × Confidence)

See `repo-assessing-criticality-confidence` Skill for complete priority matrix and execution order (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P4).

**Model Selection Justification**: This agent uses `model: sonnet` because it requires:

- Advanced reasoning to re-validate general content findings
- Sophisticated analysis of content quality issues
- Pattern recognition to detect false positives
- Complex decision-making for fix safety and confidence assessment
- Understanding of ayokoding-web content standards

Validate general-checker findings before applying fixes.

## Core

1. Read audit, 2. Re-validate, 3. Apply HIGH confidence, 4. Report

## Mode & Discovery

`repo-applying-maker-checker-fixer` Skill: mode logic, report discovery

## Confidence

`repo-assessing-criticality-confidence` Skill: definitions, examples

HIGH: Missing frontmatter, broken link
MEDIUM: Content quality, structure choices
FALSE_POSITIVE: Checker error

## Reference

## Convergence Safeguards

### Capture Changed Files for Scoped Re-validation

After applying all fixes, capture the changed files list:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

Include in the fix report under `## Changed Files (for Scoped Re-validation)`:

```markdown
## Changed Files (for Scoped Re-validation)

The following files were modified. The next checker run uses this list to enable scoped re-validation:

- path/to/modified-file-1.md
- path/to/modified-file-2.md
```

### Persist FALSE_POSITIVE Findings

After every fix run, append each FALSE_POSITIVE to `generated-reports/.known-false-positives.md`:

```bash
cat >> generated-reports/.known-false-positives.md << 'EOF'
## FALSE_POSITIVE: [category] | [file] | [brief-description]

**Accepted**: [YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM]
**Category**: [finding category]
**File**: [path/to/file.md]
**Finding**: [Brief description]
**Reason**: [Why accepted as false positive]

---
EOF
```

Also list in fix report under `## Accepted FALSE_POSITIVE Findings`.

### Self-Verification After Edits

After every edit (Edit tool or Bash sed/awk):

1. Re-read the modified file section to confirm the change was applied
2. For Bash edits: `grep -q "expected-pattern" file.md || echo "WARNING: fix NOT applied"`
3. Log as **APPLIED (verified)** or **FAILED (not applied)** in the fix report
4. Do NOT count FAILED fixes as resolved — they will be re-flagged by the checker
