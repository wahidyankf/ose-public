Drilling turns the sixteen concepts into durable skill: recall questions that force definitions from memory, applied problems that rehearse real incidents, code katas that rebuild the motions by hand, a self-check checklist that audits readiness honestly, and elaborative prompts that connect each choice to its rejected alternative. Work the sections in order, and do not peek at answers before attempting the recall.

## Recall Q&A

### Q1 (co-01): What is a migration file, and what two halves does its name carry?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

A migration file is a versioned, ordered description of one schema change. Its name carries a numeric version that fixes execution order and a human description that explains the change, for example V002\_\_add_price separates 002 from add_price. The runner sorts names into the execution plan and records both halves in the history table, so the ledger reads as documentation years later.

</details>

### Q2 (co-01): Why must migration file names sort into execution order?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Because the file listing is the only order every environment shares. Numeric zero-padded prefixes make lexical sorting equal numeric order, so V010 runs after V009 on every machine. Without sortable names, dependency order becomes an accident of whoever ran what first, and databases diverge silently.

</details>

### Q3 (co-02): What is the difference between an up migration and a down migration?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

An up migration moves the schema forward with DDL or data changes, while a down migration reverses exactly one up version and nothing else. U002 reverses V002: the pair is written together while intent is fresh, and rollback applies down files tip-down with a ledger deletion each. Ups without downs can only be fixed forward, never unwound.

</details>

### Q4 (co-02): When is a down migration the wrong recovery, and what replaces it?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Mid-split in a zero-downtime sequence, where the old shape is half-gone and the new shape is half-adopted: reversing lands nowhere valid. A forward-fix migration that completes the footprint replaces rollback there. The rule is to roll back before a split starts or after it completes, and roll forward everywhere between.

</details>

### Q5 (co-03): What does the migration history table record per row?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

One row per applied version with the version number as key, the human description, and the SHA-256 checksum of the exact bytes that ran. The runner consults it before every file through existsById, rollback deletes from it in the same transaction as the down DDL, and diagnosis reads it first because it constrains every theory about what went wrong.

</details>

### Q6 (co-03): Why should history be read through a repository instead of raw SQL?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Because the ledger is domain data and deserves the same access model: existsById answers whether a version ran, count sizes the ledger, and findAll inventories history without hand-written catalog queries. Repository reads stay correct when mappings evolve, while string-concatenated catalog SQL rots with every schema change.

</details>

### Q7 (co-04): What makes a migration history linear, and why is linear better?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Linear history gives every version exactly one predecessor and one successor, so any database state maps to a single point in the sequence. Branches force each database to answer which fork it followed, and merging forks rewrites promises some database already kept. Teams stay linear by claiming the next free number instead of forking.

</details>

### Q8 (co-04): How does numeric prefixing prevent ordering conflicts between developers?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Claimed numbers make the listing the plan: developer A takes V002 and developer B takes V003, and both files sort into the order both developers expect. The collision of two V003 files is then a review-time conversation, not a production incident, because uniqueness is checkable before any DDL runs.

</details>

### Q9 (co-05): What makes a migration idempotent, and why must reruns be safe?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Idempotent migrations produce the same database state whether attempted once or twice: ledger guards skip applied files, DDL uses IF NOT EXISTS where replays are possible, and seeds guard with NOT EXISTS. Reruns must be safe because deployments replay files constantly across fresh containers, scaled replicas, and recovered nodes.

</details>

### Q10 (co-05): How does the transaction wrapper contribute to idempotency?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

The migration DDL and its ledger row commit atomically, so a crash before commit leaves neither the change nor its record, and the retry starts clean. Without the wrapper, a retry cannot tell applied from attempted, and half-applied changes accumulate with every interrupted deploy.

</details>

### Q11 (co-06): What distinguishes a backfill from a schema change?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

A schema change alters shape with DDL while a backfill derives values with DML against the new shape, and they ship as separate versions in dependency order. The backfill assumes the schema exists and fails loudly otherwise, which keeps each step reviewable alone and each failure attributable to exactly one file.

</details>

### Q12 (co-06): Why do large backfills run in key-range batches?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Because one giant UPDATE holds locks for the whole table for the whole statement, queuing every reader behind the migration. Batched updates by primary-key ranges keep each statement small and short-lived, while one surrounding transaction preserves atomicity for the sizes this course covers.

</details>

### Q13 (co-07): What are the three phases of a zero-downtime migration?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Expand adds the new shape beside the old without touching what running code reads, migrate moves values and readers gradually while both shapes exist, and contract removes the old shape only after universal adoption. Each phase deploys alone, so any problem rolls forward to the next fix instead of backward through downtime.

</details>

### Q14 (co-07): Why can a column rename never land in a single migration?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Because old binaries write the old name the moment the new name lands, and a single-statement rename breaks every binary older than the deploy. The three-version rename overlaps old and new writers safely: expand adds display_handle, migrate copies values, and contract drops handle only when nothing reads it.

</details>

### Q15 (co-08): What must a rollback do besides reversing the schema change?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

It must delete the version's ledger row in the same transaction as the down DDL. A dropped table with a kept row lies: the next run believes the migration applied and skips it, so the table never comes back. Table and row go together, and forward can then honestly recreate both.

</details>

### Q16 (co-08): How do data rollbacks differ from schema rollbacks?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Schema rollbacks drop structures while data rollbacks restore values with mirror UPDATE statements: a status flipped to shipped flips back to pending. The ledger handling is identical in both cases, but data rollbacks need the original values recoverable from the up migration's logic, since DROP has no value-level equivalent.

</details>

### Q17 (co-09): What is schema drift, and which two directions must scans cover?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Drift is the gap between the database and its ledger: objects that exist without migrations describing them, and ledger rows whose objects are gone. Scans must cover both directions, catalog-minus-migrations for hand-made tables and ledger-minus-catalog for hand-dropped ones, because each direction hides a different class of lie.

</details>

### Q18 (co-09): How do you reconcile drift once a scan finds it?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

With an adopting migration that describes the orphaned objects as the team wishes they had been written, using IF NOT EXISTS to avoid colliding where the orphan already stands. From the adopting version on, the ledger covers reality again, and the rescan comes back clean to prove the contract holds.

</details>

### Q19 (co-10): What does baselining a database mean?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Recording ledger rows for early versions as satisfied without executing their DDL, because the existing database already lived that history. The legacy tables and their rows predate the workflow, and replaying old DDL over them would collide on every object. Baselining marks satisfied honestly and only genuinely new migrations execute.

</details>

### Q20 (co-10): What proves a baseline skipped old DDL instead of replaying it?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Legacy rows that survive adoption beside the new migration's effects: a seeded customer still readable after the baseline, with a two-row-plus-one ledger showing marked versions plus executed ones. Preserved data is the evidence that adoption served the business instead of just the process.

</details>

### Q21 (co-11): How do checksums protect applied migrations?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

The runner records the SHA-256 of each file's exact bytes at apply time, and validation recomputes fingerprints before later runs, comparing them to the ledger. Any edit to an applied file changes its fingerprint and fails validation loudly, so history cannot be rewritten quietly after databases already ran it.

</details>

### Q22 (co-11): What is the correct response to a checksum mismatch?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Stop before any DDL: investigate which edit caused it, decide whether the edit is legitimate, and either revert the file or carry the change as a new migration. Never update the ledger to match the edited file, because that rewrites the promise every applied database already kept.

</details>

### Q23 (co-12): Why must each migration run inside one transaction?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

So the change and its ledger record land together or not at all: a halfway failure rolls back to exactly the prior state with no rows and no ledger entry. PostgreSQL runs DDL transactionally, which makes the wrapper airtight for everything except statements like CONCURRENTLY that forbid transaction blocks.

</details>

### Q24 (co-12): What must transactionless migrations do differently?

<details>
<summary>Model answer</summary>

Expect partial footprints and detect them explicitly: early statements commit even when later ones fail, so the verification prints what landed and repair completes the rest as a new migration. The no-transaction marker documents the choice in the file, and the ledger row still records the run after the statements land.

</details>

## Applied problems

### Problem 1: Split a breaking rename into zero-downtime steps

Production runs version 4 of the billing schema, and the amount_cents column must become amount_minor with no downtime. Write the three versions: expand adds amount_minor nullable, migrate copies every amount across, contract drops amount_cents. Sketch the verification after each phase: catalog checks proving the new column exists, counts proving every row migrated, and the final column list. The renames in Examples 38 and the kata-06 solution are the worked models.

### Problem 2: Resolve a migration-order conflict between two branches

Branch A added V007**add_email and branch B added V007**add_phone, and both merged to main. Describe the resolution: run the version scan to confirm the collision, keep the agreed winner under V007, renumber the loser to V008 with identical bytes, and apply the restored line. Name what must never happen: editing the applied winner's file or renumbering any version already applied elsewhere. Examples 54 through 58 rehearse each move.

### Problem 3: Diagnose a partially applied migration from the history table

The deploy log shows V012 failed, the ledger holds eleven rows, and the orders table has half its expected backfill. Describe the diagnosis in order: read the ledger to confirm V012 never recorded, count the backfilled rows to size the footprint, check SQLSTATE 23505 from the log to name the duplicate-key cause, then write the repair migration that inserts only the missing rows. Examples 71 through 76 are the field guide.

### Problem 4: Promote one file set across dev, test, and production

The team needs proof that production will replay exactly what test certified. Describe the promotion: same files and order against three databases, ledger comparison across stages, and the rule that skipped stages break the evidence chain. Name the failure mode promotion prevents: environment-specific files that make test results meaningless for production. Examples 52 and 53 demonstrate the mechanism.

### Problem 5: Contain a locking migration on a hot table

The sessions table serves ten thousand reads per minute and needs a new index plus a backfill. Describe the containment: build the index CONCURRENTLY outside a transaction, backfill in key-range batches, hold only the locks each statement needs, and audit with pg_locks afterward. Name the outage each choice avoids: a locking index build queuing every reader, and a single giant UPDATE holding the table for the whole deploy. Examples 62 through 70 cover each technique.

### Problem 6: Baseline a five-year-old database without losing a row

The warehouse database predates migrations with forty tables and live data. Describe the adoption: survey the catalog first, create the ledger, mark satisfied versions without running their DDL, preserve a seeded witness row, then apply the first genuine migration and prove the witness survived. Name the disaster baselining prevents: replaying years of DDL over objects that already exist. Examples 45 through 47 and 51 walk the path.

### Problem 7: Recover a mid-split stall by rolling forward

The status rename sits half-migrated: V006 copied most rows, the deploy stalled, and rollback would strand the migrated ones. Describe the forward recovery: count the gap, write the fix migration that moves only unmigrated rows, apply it, and verify zero remain. Explain why rollback is refused here: neither the old nor the new shape is whole, so unwinding lands nowhere valid. Example 44 is the worked precedent.

### Problem 8: Adopt a drifted table back into history

The scan reports warehouse_archive exists with no migration describing it. Describe the reconciliation: inspect the table shape, write V009 with CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS matching reality, apply it, and rescan to prove clean. Name the ongoing discipline: regular scans in both directions so the next orphan is caught within days, not years. Examples 48 through 50 define the loop.

## Code katas

Eight katas rebuild the course motions by hand. Each kata ships a `before/` starter with a `todo` to replace and an `after/` solution the harness runs; the lesson embeds both so the gap between them is the exercise.

### Kata 1: Write a Migration and Its Rollback

Rolling back is a skill separate from migrating: the down file must reverse exactly its up version, and the ledger row must go with it. This kata replays the full loop from Example 21 so the motion becomes reflex.
Your solution applies the up migration, rolls back the tip, then applies forward once more, printing the table presence and ledger count after each phase.

**Output** (`drilling/code/kata-01-write-migration-and-rollback/expected/main.stdout.txt`):

```text
forward table present: 1
forward ledger rows: 1
rollback table present: 0
rollback ledger rows: 0
reapply table present: 1
reapply ledger rows: 1
```

**Key takeaway**: Rollback and reapply prove reversibility in both directions.

**Why it matters**: A migration that only moves forward strands every team that must move back; the round trip proves both.

### Kata 2: Add a Backfill Step to an Existing Migration

Schema-only migrations leave new columns empty, and the backfill step is what makes them useful. This kata adds the derivation after the shape, proving every row gained its value.
Your solution applies the schema migration, backfills the new column from existing data, and prints the derived values beside the ledger count.

-- Schema first, then data: the column exists before any UPDATE touches it.
ALTER TABLE kata02_postings
ADD COLUMN balance_cents INTEGER;

-- => nullable first: computed below for every existing row
UPDATE kata02_postings
SET
  balance_cents = amount_cents * 2;

-- => every row derives its balance from data already present
```

**Output** (`drilling/code/kata-02-add-backfill-step/expected/main.stdout.txt`):

```text
balances: 200,400,600
migrations applied: 2
```

**Key takeaway**: Derive new columns from present data; the backfill is a version like any other.

**Why it matters**: Empty new columns break readers that assume values; deriving from stored data fills them without user work.

### Kata 3: Baseline an Existing Database Without Losing Data

Adoption without loss is the whole of baselining: legacy rows survive, satisfied versions are marked, and only genuinely new migrations execute. This kata rehearses the adoption from Example 46 at small scale.
Your solution seeds the legacy table, marks V001 satisfied, applies V002 for real, and prints the preserved row beside the two-row ledger.

@Repository // => component-scanned persistence interface
public interface MigrationHistoryRepository extends JpaRepository<MigrationHistory, String> {
  // => String keys versions
  // => no method body needed: existsById, save, count come from JpaRepository
}
```

**`drilling/code/kata-03-baseline-existing-database/V001__legacy_stock.sql`**:

```sql
-- V001 describes the stock table that predates the workflow here.
-- Baselined: the legacy setup created it, this file only names the version.
CREATE TABLE kata03_stock_placeholder (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);

-- => placeholder keeps the file honest about the version it represents
```

**`drilling/code/kata-03-baseline-existing-database/V002__add_quantity.sql`**:

```sql
-- V002 adds the quantity column to the adopted stock table.
-- The first executed migration on a baselined database: everything new runs.
ALTER TABLE kata03_stock
ADD COLUMN quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- => DEFAULT keeps adopted rows valid the moment the column appears
```

**Output** (`drilling/code/kata-03-baseline-existing-database/expected/main.stdout.txt`):

```text
baselined versions: 001
stock rows: 1
quantity column present: 1
```

**Key takeaway**: Adoption preserves rows while marking history; the witness row is the proof.

**Why it matters**: A baseline that loses data trades the past for process; preservation proves the adoption served both.

### Kata 4: Resolve a Migration-Order Conflict

Two branches claimed V002 and the scan caught it before any DDL ran. Resolution keeps the winner's number, renumbers the loser, and applies the agreed line. This kata replays the rebase from Example 58.
Your solution detects the collision, applies the winner, rebases the loser onto the tip, and prints the three-row ledger the agreement produced.

```sql
-- V003 carries the loser's change rebased onto the new tip.
-- The loser rebases, never the ledger: applied numbers stay spent.
ALTER TABLE kata04_base
ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(40);

-- => the same bytes under an honest new number
```

**Output** (`drilling/code/kata-04-resolve-order-conflict/expected/main.stdout.txt`):

```text
resolved ledger: 001 002 003
resolved columns: 2
```

**Key takeaway**: Collisions resolve at review time by renumbering the loser, never the ledger.

**Why it matters**: Production is the most expensive place to discover two V002 files; resolution before DDL keeps both teams safe.

### Kata 5: Diagnose a Partial Migration

The partial run seeded one row and missed the second; diagnosis counts the gap before repair closes it. This kata stages the detection and the fix as separate versions so the ledger tells the story.
Your solution applies the partial footprint, prints the gap, runs the repair migration, and prints the completed counts.

```

```sql
-- V002 is the repair migration: it adds the row the partial run missed.
-- Repair never edits the failed file, it completes the footprint forward.
INSERT INTO
  kata05_repairs (name)
VALUES
  ('second');

-- => the missing row lands with its own version and ledger entry
```

**Output** (`drilling/code/kata-05-diagnose-partial-migration/expected/main.stdout.txt`):

```text
partial rows: 1
repaired rows: 2
migrations applied: 2
```

**Key takeaway**: Diagnose the gap first, then repair forward; the ledger tells the story.

**Why it matters**: Blind reruns of partial work compound the damage; measured repair completes exactly what is missing.

### Kata 6: Split a Breaking Change into Zero-Downtime Steps

The rename cannot land in one version without breaking old readers, so the kata splits it exactly as Example 38 teaches. Each phase deploys alone and the final shape carries no trace of the old name.
Your solution applies the expand, migrate, and contract versions in order and prints the surviving columns.

-- => one member stands in for live traffic across the split

-- => seeds share the migration transaction with the create above
```

```sql
-- V002 migrates handles into nicknames while both names exist.
UPDATE kata06_members

  nickname IS NULL;

-- => old rows adopt the new name from values already present
```

**`drilling/code/kata-06-split-zero-downtime/V003__contract_handle6.sql`**:

```sql
-- V003 drops the old handle after universal adoption of nickname.
ALTER TABLE kata06_members
DROP COLUMN handle;

-- => one name remains: the split done without breaking any reader
```

**Output** (`drilling/code/kata-06-split-zero-downtime/expected/main.stdout.txt`):

```text
handle present: 0
nickname value: rider7
```

**Key takeaway**: Three versions carry a rename past every deployed binary without breaking one.

**Why it matters**: Single-version renames break old readers instantly; the split overlaps them safely.

### Kata 7: Validate Before Applying

Validation before DDL is what keeps the course's later diagnoses theoretical. This kata runs the checksum gate from Example 25 and applies only after it passes.
Your solution validates the file set, prints the pending count and mismatch count, applies, and prints the ledger the gate certified.

**Key takeaway**: Validation gates every run; clean checksums are the license to apply.

**Why it matters**: Failures caught in validation need no rollback; the gate keeps diagnosis theoretical.

### Kata 8: Repair a Failed Migration

The failed migration left the ledger clean and the table empty; repair completes the intent as a new version instead of editing the failure. This kata closes the loop from Examples 71 and 73 in one solution.
Your solution attempts the failing file, reports its SQLSTATE, runs the repair migration, and prints the completed rows.

**`drilling/code/kata-08-repair-failed/course/MigrationHistoryRepository.java`**:

```java
package course; // => scanned beside the entity it manages

// The history repository is the only writer of migration ledger rows.
// Every applied check below (existsById, count, findAll) reads through it,
// so the ledger is Spring Data JPA data access, not raw JDBC bookkeeping.
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; // => CRUD plus paging and sorting
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository; // => marks the persistence component

@Repository // => component-scanned persistence interface
public interface MigrationHistoryRepository extends JpaRepository<MigrationHistory, String> {
  // => String keys versions
  // => no method body needed: existsById, save, count come from JpaRepository
}
```

**`drilling/code/kata-08-repair-failed/V001__create_strict8.sql`**:

```sql
-- V001 creates the strict table the repair below fills correctly.
CREATE TABLE kata08_strict (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  -- => SERIAL gives an auto-incrementing integer key
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
  -- => UNIQUE tripped the original failure the repair respects
);
```

**`drilling/code/kata-08-repair-failed/V002__repair_seed8.sql`**:

```sql
-- V002 is the repair migration: it seeds the rows the failure never wrote.
-- Repair moves forward with valid data instead of editing the failed file.
INSERT INTO
  kata08_strict (name)
VALUES
  ('alpha'),
  ('beta');

-- => two valid rows land with their own version and ledger entry
```

**Output** (`drilling/code/kata-08-repair-failed/expected/main.stdout.txt`):

```text
repaired rows: 2
migrations applied: 2
```

**Key takeaway**: Repair completes failed intent as a new version; history stays immutable.

**Why it matters**: Editing failed files hides the lesson; forward repair preserves both the data and the story.

## Self-check checklist

1. I can write a versioned migration file whose name carries both order and intent.
2. I can structure an up migration so its reverse down file is writable beside it.
3. I can read the migration history table through a Spring Data JPA repository.
4. I can keep history linear by claiming version numbers instead of forking.
5. I can make reruns safe no-ops with ledger guards and idempotent statements.
6. I can separate a backfill from its schema change into dependency-ordered versions.
7. I can split a breaking change into expand, migrate, and contract phases.
8. I can roll back a tip version and delete its ledger row in one transaction.
9. I can detect schema drift in both directions with catalog and ledger scans.
10. I can baseline a legacy database while preserving every row it holds.
11. I can validate checksums before applying and refuse edited history loudly.
12. I can wrap migrations transactionally and name what transactionless files risk.
13. I can promote identical files across dev, test, and production and compare ledgers.
14. I can resolve a version collision by rebasing the loser onto the new tip.
15. I can scope locks to the tables a migration changes and audit them.
16. I can diagnose a failure from its SQLSTATE instead of guessing from text.
17. I can test each migration with the query that proves its effect.
18. I can order multi-file plans with zero-padded numeric prefixes past V009.
19. I can explain down migrations and when forward fixes replace them.
20. I can describe what each history row records and why checksums bind it.
21. I can backfill in small key-range batches under read load.
22. I can build hot-table indexes concurrently outside transactions.
23. I can complete partial runs with repair migrations that move forward.
24. I can close a course of migrations with an ordered, verified, trusted ledger.

## Elaborative interrogation & self-explanation

### Prompt 1: Why versioned files instead of a single evolving schema.sql?

The rejected alternative keeps one schema.sql describing the current shape, reapplied fresh each deploy. Versioned files win because production databases hold data that a fresh schema would destroy: migrations describe transitions, not states, and the ledger records which transitions each database already survived. A single schema file cannot express order, cannot roll back one change, and cannot tell two environments apart. Files version the journey; schema.sql only photographs the destination.

### Prompt 2: Why pair every migration with a ledger row instead of tracking runs in deploy logs?

Deploy logs seem sufficient until the questions get hard: which versions did this replica apply, in what order, with what bytes. Logs scatter across systems, rotate away, and never answer idempotently whether V007 ran here. The ledger row lives beside the data it describes, answers existsById in one query, and makes reruns self-deciding instead of log archaeology. Co-location beats correlation: history belongs with the thing it histories.

### Prompt 3: Why forbid editing applied migrations instead of allowing careful fixes?

The alternative lets teams fix typos in place after applying, trusting review to keep it safe. Immutability wins because applied bytes are promises databases already kept: two environments that applied different bytes under one version can never converge again, and no log records which bytes ran where. Checksums enforce what discipline only requests. New migrations carry fixes forward; edited files rewrite a past nobody can revisit.

### Prompt 4: Why roll back tip-down instead of removing any version directly?

Removing a middle version seems faster when only it is broken, but later versions may depend on its effects: dropping V002 while V003 references its column leaves a schema no file describes. Tip-down unwind preserves the invariant that the ledger always names a prefix of the file sequence, so every state matches some real point in history. The discipline trades one slower recovery for a guarantee that recovery always lands somewhere valid.

### Prompt 5: Why run one migration per transaction instead of batching a release into one commit?

Batching seems atomic in the appealing way: a whole release lands or nothing does. Per-migration transactions win because failures then identify exactly one file, reruns skip exactly the applied prefix, and the ledger records progress through long releases instead of all-or-nothing gambles. A batched release that fails at file nine of twelve leaves operators guessing what landed; per-file transactions leave a ledger that says so.

### Prompt 6: Why not let the ORM generate the schema instead of writing migrations?

hbm2ddl-style generation is seductive: entities already describe the shape, so let the provider sync it. Explicit migrations win for every reason this course exists: generated DDL cannot backfill, cannot split zero-downtime phases, cannot roll back one change, leaves no reviewable history, and differs silently between versions. The entity model describes the destination; migrations describe the journey with its data, order, and reversals intact.
