# Example 7: Write Your First Task Brief
# => Fixture shim of the Pi coding agent surface.
# => Target release 1.3.0, checked on 2026-10-20.
# => Deterministic: no network, key, or billing.
# => Real behaviour may differ; see pi.dev/docs/latest.
# => A brief is a contract the agent cannot wiggle out of.
task = "summarize open issues"  # => one verb plus one object
scope = "notes/"  # => the boundary of the job
done = "markdown list of 5 issues"  # => the measurable finish line
guardrails = ["read-only", "no network"]  # => the limits on the run
# => Four of four is submittable; less means rewrite.
slots = [task, scope, done, guardrails]  # => the four slots
score = sum(1 for s in slots if s)  # => count filled slots
# => Print the score so the starting point is on record.
print("brief-score:", score, "of 4")  # => Output grades it
# => The verdict names the bar for reuse elsewhere.
print("submittable:", score == 4)  # => True when complete
