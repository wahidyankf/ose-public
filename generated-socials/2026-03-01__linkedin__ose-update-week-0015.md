🏗️ The Infrastructure Marathon: 137 Commits, 2 Plans Closed, Full Stack Updated

Week 3 of Phase 1. This was the biggest week yet — two formal plans completed, every project touched.

**Week 0015 Progress:**

CI Standardization (Plan 1 — Closed):

- Canonical Nx targets (typecheck, lint, test:quick) enforced across all 11 projects
- Typecheck + lint gates added to pre-push hook; oxlint + vitest added to organiclever-fe
- Nx upgraded to 22.5.2; golangci-lint consolidated to repo root

Dependency Sweep (Plan 2 — Closed):

- Next.js 14 → 16, TailwindCSS v3 → v4 (two major upgrades in one week)
- Hugo themes, Go 1.26, Flutter, Spring Boot 4.0.3, Node.js updated
- TypeScript: noUncheckedIndexedAccess enabled across all projects

Go Ecosystem Expansion:

- 80% test coverage enforced on all 5 Go projects
- New `golang-commons` + `hugo-commons` shared libs (link checker utilities)
- New `oseplatform-cli` (links check) + `javaproject-cli` (Java null-safety validator, extracted from rhino-cli)
- ayokoding-web: 96 broken internal links fixed; links check added to test:quick

OrganicLever Hardening:

- Storybook 10 added; 12 E2E tests fixed across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit; WebKit auth bug fixed
- Docker Compose dev + CI integration; PR quality gate + scheduled E2E workflows
- organiclever-be: JSpecify + NullAway null safety enforcement; organiclever-app-web-e2e deferred
- Scheduled deploy workflows for ayokoding-web + oseplatform-web; Nx cascade builds fixed
- apps-labs: hello-rust-be (Actix Web + Tokio) — early Rust exploration

**Infrastructure Checklist:**

- ✅ Development environment (rhino-cli doctor)
- ✅ E2E test infrastructure (Playwright for 3 apps)
- ✅ Canonical Nx target standards (all 11 projects)
- ✅ Dependency sweep (full stack up to date)
- ✅ Go test coverage enforcement (≥80%, all 5 projects)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline hardening + scheduled deployments
- ✅ Go tooling ecosystem (4 CLIs + 2 shared libs)
- 🔄 Feature development: not yet

Phase 1 Goal: Organic Lever (productivity tracker)
Stack: Next.js (web — prototype fast) + Flutter (Android/iOS — optimized UX)
Timeline: 12-16 weeks, Insha Allah

Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. Infrastructure before features.

---

Last week: E2E testing suite + governance hardening
This week: CI standardization + dependency sweep + Go ecosystem (137 commits, 2 plans closed)
Next week: Gherkin integration in integration + E2E tests, more CI/CD improvements (OrganicLever apps), Insha Allah

Every commit is visible on GitHub. Monthly updates every second Sunday of the month.
