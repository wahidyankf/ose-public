# Standardize rhino-cli Checks & SDLC Commands Across the Three OSE Repos

**Status**: Completed

**Type**: Multi-file plan (5 documents) — **one giant 3-repo execution plan**

> This is a **single comprehensive plan that executes across all three repos** (`ose-public` →

> start of its phase so the same checklist drives execution there.

## Context

The three sibling repos — `ose-public`, `ose-primer`, `ose-infra` — each ship the same `rhino-cli`
Rust tool and the same SDLC quality machinery (commit-msg, pre-commit, pre-push, PR quality gate,
main-branch CI, markdown/env validation, and scheduled "test + deploy" CRON pipelines). Over time
the wiring has **drifted**: the same logical gate is named differently, scoped differently, placed
in a different workflow file, or invoked through a different mechanism (inline shell vs. an Nx-wrapped
rhino-cli target) in each repo.

This plan inventories **every** rhino-cli command, triages each as **wired** (invoked by some
lifecycle automation), **not wired** (exists but only runnable manually), or **preflight** (run by the
`repo-rules-quality-gate` Step 0.5 preflight — automated within that agent workflow, but not a
per-commit/CI gate), maps the full SDLC
surface across all three repos, derives a single **best-of-three target standard**, and converges
all three repos to produce `"identical"` gate **mechanics** — identical in hook ordering, gate
names, workflow filenames, validator sets, and invocation mechanism. App-set differences (which
deploy CRONs exist, which language gates run) remain legitimately divergent.

## Scope

**In scope** (all three repos):

- Triage of every `rhino-cli` subcommand → wired / not-wired / preflight (see [tech-docs.md §Command Triage](./tech-docs.md#3-rhino-cli-command-triage-wired-vs-not-wired)).
- Cross-repo SDLC matrix for: commit-msg, pre-commit, pre-push, PR quality-gate, main-branch CI, env-validate, and the "test local + deploy stag" / "test stag + deploy prod" CRON pipelines (markdown validation folds into the gates — no standalone markdown workflow).
- **Nx target-name standardization** — every Nx target invoked by a hook/CI uses one canonical name (`test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:e2e`, `test:quick`, `test:coverage`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `specs:behavior:coverage`, `specs:domain:coverage`, and the `{domain}:{work}` validation targets) identical across all three repos; the rhino-cli target set itself converges. **Formatting is removed as a per-project target** (no `format`/`format:check`) and handled by file-type lint-staged. See [tech-docs §5](./tech-docs.md#5-nx-target-name-standard-targets-invoked-by-hooksci) and [§8.1](./tech-docs.md#81-nx-target-name-drift-rhino-cli).
- **Testing-architecture & target-contents standard** — every project (direct child of `apps/`/`libs/`) declares the mandatory six targets (`test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:e2e`, `test:quick`, `lint`, `typecheck`) even as `echo` placeholders, plus a native `test:coverage` (≥ 90%, replacing the removed rhino-cli `test-coverage`), `specs:behavior:coverage` (renamed from `specs:coverage`), and `specs:domain:coverage` gated by the explicit `specs.domain-areas` allowlist in `repo-config.yml` (not folder-presence, not the `*-be` name suffix — per the explicit-config principle; today the listed set is the `*-be` backends); `test:quick` = typecheck→lint→test:unit→test:coverage→test:specs in order (unit + coverage + specs enforced inside test:quick; all present on every project, echo where N/A); **unit and integration tests live in separate folders** (TS/F#: `tests/unit` vs `tests/integration`; Rust: co-located `#[cfg(test)]` + external `tests/`); the three test levels consume the same Gherkin; BE integration is service-level, FE has none unless DB-backed, `test:e2e` is real only on `*-e2e`; pre-push/PR/main-ci run `test:quick` (plus `compat:min-version`) while pre-commit stays fast (format + tool-lint + guards, no `test:quick`), and the gates are **cacheable-by-construction** so no gate runs the heavy/uncacheable tiers — integration, e2e, and `deps:audit` are all CRON-only; rhino-cli enforces per-level coverage via explicit `@covers` markers (the §4.1 registry + self-tag model); every project uses one **identical C4 specs structure** (`product`/`system-context`/`containers`/`components`/`behavior/.../gherkin` mandatory for apps and libs, gherkin in every area, `ddd/` only for the `specs.ddd-areas` allowlist), with app specs **domain-keyed** (`specs/apps/<domain>/` per `apps/<domain>-*` family) and lib specs per-project; two cross-language dependency targets round out every project — `deps:audit` (CVE + license; CRON-only, uncacheable) and `compat:min-version` (min-version-floor build; in the gates, cacheable; real only on Rust + Python). See [tech-docs §4](./tech-docs.md#4-testing-architecture--target-contents-standard) and the symmetric [per-project target matrix §2.1](./tech-docs.md#21-per-project-target-matrix-post-implementation-ose-public).
- **rhino-cli command-naming standardization** — every CLI leaf command converges to **verb-last** `{domain} {sub-domain…} {verb}` (e.g. `convention validate emoji` → `convention emoji validate`), while Nx/`project.json` targets stay `:`-separated `{domain}:{work}`/lifecycle. In the triage table the **target** (end-state) command column comes **before** the current-form column. See [tech-docs §3.1](./tech-docs.md#31-two-naming-conventions-locked) and the triage target column.
- **rhino-cli merge/drop recommendations** — the plan recommends a **keep / merge / drop / wire** verdict per command to collapse redundancy (e.g. fold `harness claude validate` + `harness sync validate` → `harness bindings validate`; `specs bc`/`specs ul` → `specs structure validate` (the structural validator, gated by `specs.ddd-areas` — revised from `domain-coverage` during ratification); drop `git pre-commit` + `test-coverage validate` + the md domain-shortcuts), preserving the identical-command-set invariant. See [tech-docs §3.3](./tech-docs.md#33-merge--drop-recommendations).
- **harness binding coverage (all supported harnesses)** — the `harness` commands must cover **every** coding-agent harness the repo binds (Claude Code, OpenCode, Amazon Q, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Junie, Antigravity, Pi, Aider — 11 total across source/generated/native tiers), driven by a `harness:` section in `repo-config.yml`, not just OpenCode + Amazon Q as today. See [tech-docs §3.2](./tech-docs.md#32-harness-binding-coverage-standard-all-supported-harnesses).
- **Unified repo configuration** — merge `instruction-size-budget.yaml` + `env-contract.yaml` + `env-injection.yaml` into a single root `repo-config.yml` (namespaced sections) in all three repos. See [tech-docs §5.1](./tech-docs.md#51-unified-repo-configuration-repo-configyml).
- **Codecov removal** — no third-party coverage service in any repo (native `test:coverage` only); delete the last live `ose-infra/codecov.yml` + scrub stale references.
- **Git-identity guard removed → agent guardrail** — delete the `scripts/git-identity-check.sh` pre-commit block (it over-restricted humans who legitimately commit under different per-repo identities) and replace it with a behavioral **Git Identity Guardrail** in `AGENTS.md` + a governance convention: no AI agent sets/modifies `user.name`/`user.email` at any scope; humans use global `~/.gitconfig` / `includeIf`. See [tech-docs §1](./tech-docs.md#1-lifecycle-stage--exact-commands-post-implementation-identical-across-3-repos).
- **Standardized GitHub CI for every project** — the plan completes when every project across all three repos is covered by a GitHub CI whose workflow filenames + job structure follow the canonical **ose-public** convention (`pr-quality-gate.yml`, `validate-env.yml`, `main-ci.yml`; markdown validation folds into the gates — no standalone `validate-markdown.yml`). See [tech-docs §8.2](./tech-docs.md#82-github-ci-workflow-inventory-current--target-per-repo).
- **Worktree-agnostic guardrails** — every guardrail (the `.husky` hooks, the rhino-cli `validate`/`generate` commands, `lint-staged`, and the Nx targets they invoke) runs identically whether executed from the **primary checkout** (`.git/` is a directory) or a **linked worktree** (`worktrees/<name>/`, where `.git` is a gitdir-pointer file and the object store/refs live in the common dir). Git introspection resolves the **current** tree via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and shared metadata via `--git-common-dir`; no guardrail assumes `.git/` is a directory or resolves `repo-config.yml`/exclude/fixture paths against the main checkout. This matters most in `ose-infra`, a **bare repo worked only through linked worktrees** — there the worktree case is the _sole_ execution context. A rhino-cli regression test runs a guardrail from a synthetic linked worktree to lock it. See [tech-docs §1 Worktree-agnostic execution](./tech-docs.md#1-lifecycle-stage--exact-commands-post-implementation-identical-across-3-repos). [Repo-grounded — rhino-cli already uses `--show-toplevel`; the invariant, test, and verification are new]
- **Identical-result invariant** — the end-state of the entire standardization layer (rhino-cli command set + verb-last naming, `:`-separated Nx target conventions, `repo-config.yml` schema, hook/gate mechanics + step order, lint-staged map, canonical CI workflow names) is **identical across all three repos**, so working cross-repo feels identical, logical, and intuitive. The only divergence is each repo's project/app set. See [tech-docs §7 north-star](./tech-docs.md#7-target-standard-best-of-three-synthesis).
- A single **target standard** for gate mechanics, derived best-of-three.
- Per-repo convergence edits to reach that standard.

**Out of scope** (legitimate divergence — see [tech-docs.md §Divergence Policy](./tech-docs.md#71-divergence-policy-allowed-vs-drift)):

- Which deployable apps each repo has, and therefore which per-app CRON deploy workflows exist.
- Which programming-language gates run (public = content/web apps; primer = polyglot demo backends; infra = coralpolyp + IaC).
- Infra-only IaC gates (terraform / ansible / yamllint).
- The behaviour of individual validators (this plan standardizes **wiring**, not validator logic).

## Approach Summary

1. **Phase 0** — environment baseline in `ose-public`.
2. **Phase 1** — author the committed analysis artifacts (command triage, SDLC + testing-architecture standard) under `docs/reference/`; extend the canonical Nx naming docs; add the rhino-cli per-level `@covers` coverage model (`specs:behavior:coverage` + `specs:domain:coverage`).
3. **Phase 2** — converge `ose-public`: target names, hooks, workflow renames, per-project target-contents sweep, **post-merge main-ci fast gate; heavy tests + deploy stay CRON-only** (2f).
4. **Phase 3** — propagate to `ose-primer` and converge it with **its own granular sub-steps** (3a–3e), including the 26-project mandatory-six sweep and template-mode post-merge CI.
5. **Phase 4** — propagate to `ose-infra` and converge it with **its own granular sub-steps** (4a–4e), including coralpolyp staging deploy and recorded IaC divergence.
6. **Phase 5** — cross-repo parity verification (incl. the per-project matrices and post-merge behaviour) + archival.

`test:quick` (+ the markdown/env/specs/governance validators) runs at **pre-push and the PR gate for _affected_ projects** (`nx affected`) and at **post-merge `main-ci.yml` for _all_ projects** (`nx run-many --all`) — the PR gate is the union of what pre-commit ∪ pre-push run, and `main-ci.yml` is that same check set widened to the whole repo; the only gate-to-gate difference is scope, never the check list. Pre-commit stays fast (format + tool-lint + guards, no `test:quick`); every gate runs its independent checks **in parallel**; **`test:integration` + `test:e2e` + staging/prod deploy run only in the scheduled CRON pipelines** ([§6](./tech-docs.md#6-post-merge-main-ci--per-project-staging-deploy)) — never in any gate.
